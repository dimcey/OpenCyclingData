# OpenCyclingData
The idea is to crowd source bicycling data in terms of the cycling routes and times to improve biking conditions in cities.
With the help of this data, the city, municipality or region could maintain and provide biking routes that correspond to the demand and enhance services on busy routes. For instance cleaning the busy routes during snow conditions, or building new tracks on popular areas. Also analysis in terms of traffic (e.g. traffic lights) could consider the cycling data.

The user just needs to run a mobile application while he is biking to track the route. The tracked routes will then be sent to the server. The anonymously gathered data will be accessible via an open REST API. Also, a web interface is developed that will fetch the gathered data from the API.
